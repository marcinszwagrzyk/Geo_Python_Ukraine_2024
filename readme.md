### **Spatial Data Visualization with Python**

**Date:** **Thursday, March 21st, 18:00 - 20:00 CET (Rome, Berlin, Paris timezone)**

**Speaker:** **Marcin Szwagrzyk is a geographer with a Ph.D. in geography, acquired at Jagiellonian University in Cracow (Poland). His thesis was focusing on modeling future land use changes.**

**Over the years, he has accumulated extensive experience in various aspects of the geospatial industry, dabbling in flood risk modeling, air quality measurements, and spatial data analytics for financial institutions.**

Description: In this workshop, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles behind representing the Earth's surface on a flat, two-dimensional plane. Participants will get to know the most popular cartographic projections, their pros and cons. Emphasis will be placed on the selection of a cartographic projection tailored to specific objectives.

Equipped with this expertise, attendees will craft two professionally polished, publication-ready maps. The raw data, acquired from the freely available sources will be processed and analyzed with the use of the geopandas Python library. Subsequently, we will employ the matplotlib library to visualize the data - by leveraging popular cartographic techniques, including graduated colors and proportional symbols. **
